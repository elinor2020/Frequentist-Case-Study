Frequentist-Case-Study: Having completed this project notebook, you now have good hands-on experience:
using the central limit theorem to help you apply frequentist techniques to answer questions that pertain to very non-normally distributed data from the real world
performing inference using such data to answer business questions
forming a hypothesis and framing the null and alternative hypotheses
testing this using a t-test
